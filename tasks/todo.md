# Django Web App - Development Plan

## Overview
Building a production-ready Django app with user authentication, Stripe payments, wallet system, and n8n workflow integration.

## Architecture
- **users app**: Custom user model, authentication
- **wallet app**: Wallet transactions, Stripe integration
- **workflows app**: n8n workflow triggering, usage tracking

## Todo Items

### High Priority - Core Setup
- [ ] Set up Django project structure with apps (users, wallet, workflows)
- [ ] Create custom User model with email authentication
- [ ] Create WalletTransaction model for wallet operations
- [ ] Create WorkflowUsage model for tracking n8n workflow usage
- [ ] Implement user authentication endpoints (signup, login)
- [ ] Create Stripe Checkout integration for wallet top-up
- [ ] Implement Stripe webhook handler for payment confirmation
- [ ] Create API endpoint for triggering n8n workflows
- [ ] Implement wallet balance checking and deduction logic

### Medium Priority - Configuration & Admin
- [ ] Set up Django settings modularization (base, dev, prod)
- [ ] Set up Django Admin for monitoring users, balances, and logs
- [ ] Add authentication middleware and rate limiting
- [ ] Create requirements.txt and environment configuration

### Low Priority - Deployment & Testing
- [ ] Add deployment configuration for Heroku/Render
- [ ] Write basic tests for critical functionality

## Key Features
1. **Authentication**: Email-based signup/login
2. **Wallet System**: Stripe integration for top-ups, balance tracking
3. **Workflow Integration**: Secure n8n webhook triggering with fee deduction
4. **Admin Interface**: Monitor users, transactions, and usage
5. **Security**: Rate limiting, authentication middleware

## Models Overview
- **User**: Custom user with email auth, wallet balance
- **WalletTransaction**: Track deposits, withdrawals, fees
- **WorkflowUsage**: Log workflow triggers and associated costs

### ✅ Implementation Complete

All planned features have been successfully implemented:

#### 🏗️ **Core Architecture**
- **Clean Django project structure** with 3 focused apps: `users`, `wallet`, `workflows`
- **Modular settings** (base, development, production) for different environments
- **UUID primary keys** for enhanced security and scalability
- **Custom User model** with email-based authentication

#### 🔐 **Authentication & Security**
- **JWT token-based authentication** with DRF integration
- **Email/password signup and login** endpoints
- **Rate limiting** (10 requests/minute) for workflow triggers
- **CSRF protection** and secure headers for production
- **Environment-based configuration** with python-decouple

#### 💰 **Payment & Wallet System**
- **Stripe Checkout integration** for seamless wallet top-ups
- **Webhook handler** for payment confirmation with signature verification
- **Transaction logging** for all wallet operations (deposits, withdrawals, fees)
- **Balance validation** before workflow execution
- **Atomic transactions** to prevent race conditions

#### 🔄 **Workflow Integration**  
- **Secure n8n webhook triggering** with authentication
- **Automatic fee deduction** ($0.10 configurable) per workflow
- **Usage tracking** with request/response logging
- **Error handling** with detailed logging for failed workflows
- **Database transactions** ensuring data consistency

#### 🛠️ **Admin & Monitoring**
- **Django Admin interface** with custom configurations
- **User management** with wallet balance visibility
- **Transaction monitoring** with filtering and search
- **Workflow usage tracking** with collapsible JSON data
- **Comprehensive logging** for all operations

#### 📦 **Production Ready**
- **Heroku/Render deployment** configuration (Procfile, runtime.txt)
- **PostgreSQL production database** support
- **Static file serving** with WhiteNoise
- **Environment variable management** with .env.example
- **Comprehensive README** with setup instructions

#### 🧪 **Testing**
- **Unit tests** for User model and authentication
- **API endpoint testing** setup
- **Wallet operations testing** (balance checks, deductions)
- **All tests passing** ✅
